**Mission:** Build confidence with StoryMode controls and submit one low-stakes check-in.

## Teacher prep (before class)
- Print **Handout 03** (StoryMode confidence checklist).
- Make sure students can find Downloads and open saved files.

## Materials
- Devices with Piper StoryMode
- Timer visible
- Handouts (if used)

## Agenda (60 minutes)
**0:00–0:05 Launch**
- “Hands off keys.”
- Say today’s mission.
- Quick preview: one successful guided step + one check-in upload.

**0:05–0:12 Micro-lesson (demo)**
- Demo the full student workflow once:
  - open StoryMode,
  - complete one guided step,
  - save evidence (screenshot or short note),
  - upload privately.
- Teach: this is a confidence milestone, not a complexity milestone.

**0:12–0:42 Build sprints**
**Sprint A:** Launch StoryMode and complete one guided step.  
**Reset:** Save + teacher check that student can relaunch independently.  
**Sprint B:** Capture one screenshot or write a 2-3 sentence reflection.  
**Reset:** Stand + save.  
**Sprint C:** Upload check-in artifact (`.png/.jpg/.txt`) privately.

**0:42–0:52 Playtest rotation**
- Prompt: “What part of the workflow still feels confusing?”
- Pairs help each other find one missing step (open, save, or upload).

**0:52–1:00 Share + Save**
- 2–3 shares.
- Everyone writes: “Next time I will…” (one sentence).

## Checkpoints (what you must see working)
- Student can open and complete one guided StoryMode step.
- Student can submit one proof-of-progress artifact.

## Common stuck points + fixes
