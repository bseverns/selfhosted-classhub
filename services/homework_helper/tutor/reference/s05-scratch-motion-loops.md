# Reference: s05-scratch-motion-loops

## Lesson summary
- Title: Scratch: Motion + Loops
- Session: 5
- Makes: A sprite that moves in a loop and changes backdrop once.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Scratch (web or app)']

## Do
- [ ] Open Scratch.
- [ ] Make the sprite move 10 steps.
- [ ] Put the motion inside a `forever` loop.
- [ ] Change backdrop once during the loop.
- [ ] Download as `S05_move_v1.sb3`.
- [ ] Upload to LMS.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Sprite does not move. Check: make sure `move` is inside a `forever` loop under a start block. Retest: click green flag and watch for at least 3 seconds.
- Symptom: Backdrop never changes. Check: add one explicit backdrop-change block inside the running script. Retest: run once and confirm one visible change.
- Symptom: Loop is too fast to read. Check: add a short `wait` block (0.2-0.5 seconds). Retest: adjust once and compare smoothness.

## Extend
- Add a second sprite that appears when the backdrop changes.
- Add a sound only when the backdrop changes.
- Purpose: introduce the stage/sprite mental model and loops.
- Common snags:
  - Students forget to download.
  - Loops run too fast, add waits.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
