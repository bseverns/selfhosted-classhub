# Reference: s04-pipercode-debugging

## Lesson summary
- Title: PiperCode: Blocks + Debugging
- Session: 4
- Makes: A tiny block program + a first bug report practice.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Piper desktop']

## Do
- [ ] Open `Pipercode`.
- [ ] Create a new project.
- [ ] Add 2–5 blocks and run it.
- [ ] Save your project.
- [ ] Screenshot your blocks.
- [ ] Fill out one bug report (even if you’re not stuck).

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Blocks do not run. Check: verify there is a start trigger block and run button was used once. Retest: run with only 2-3 blocks first, then add more.
- Symptom: Student cannot tell what changed. Check: name one block changed and one visible result expected. Retest: run before/after and compare one behavior.
- Symptom: Bug report is vague. Check: include "what I expected / what happened / one screenshot." Retest: rerun steps and confirm the same bug reproduces.

## Extend
- Break one thing on purpose and fix it.
- Swap the order of two blocks and observe the change.
- Purpose: teach that debugging is normal and describable.
- Common snags:
  - Students don’t know what changed.
  - Screenshots missing blocks, teach zoom/fit.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
