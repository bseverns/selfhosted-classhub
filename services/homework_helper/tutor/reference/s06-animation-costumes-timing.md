- Makes: A short looping animation using costume changes.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Scratch (web or app)']

## Do
- [ ] Open your Session 5 project or start new.
- [ ] Create or import 2 costumes for a sprite.
- [ ] Code: `forever → next costume → wait`.
- [ ] Adjust wait to feel right.
- [ ] Download as `S06_animation_v1.sb3`.
- [ ] Upload to LMS.

## Help

- Check Downloads and try again.

- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Animation does not play. Check: confirm script uses `next costume` inside `forever` and starts on green flag. Retest: run once and watch a full cycle.
- Symptom: Animation is too fast or too slow. Check: change only the `wait` value by one step. Retest: compare before/after and keep the clearer timing.
- Symptom: Student stuck editing costumes only. Check: timebox costume edits and return to script testing. Retest: run animation before adding more art detail.

## Extend
- Animate a second sprite with a different tempo.
- Add a backdrop change every 8 costume switches.
- Purpose: teach time as a design material (pacing).
- Common snags:
  - Animation too fast or too slow.
  - Students stuck in costume editor, timebox.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
