# Reference: s07-animation-scene-sound

## Lesson summary
- Title: Animation II: Scene + Sound
- Session: 7
- Makes: A micro-scene with two characters and a clear beginning/shift/end.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Scratch (web or app)']

## Do
- [ ] Choose or import 2 sprites.
- [ ] Choose or import 1 backdrop.
- [ ] Animate at least one sprite (costumes or motion).
- [ ] Add one ‘shift’ moment (sound, message, or backdrop change).
- [ ] Add an ending cue (stop, fade, or final pose).
- [ ] Download as `S07_scene_v1.sb3` and upload.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Scene shift never happens. Check: ensure one trigger event (broadcast, click, or key) connects start to shift action. Retest: activate trigger once and verify the shift moment.
- Symptom: Sound repeats too much. Check: move sound block to one event path instead of inside a fast loop. Retest: run for 10 seconds and count repeats.
- Symptom: Project feels chaotic. Check: define clear beginning, shift, and ending cues with one block sequence each. Retest: play once and verify all three beats.

## Extend
- Add subtitles (text) for accessibility.
- Add a ‘quiet mode’ toggle that disables sound.
- Purpose: move from loops into authored moments and narrative beats.
- Common snags:
  - Asset hunting spirals, provide a pack.
  - Sound triggers overwhelm, keep sound optional.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
