# Reference: s11-packaging-start-screen

## Lesson summary
- Title: Packaging: Start Screen + Instructions
- Session: 11
- Makes: A polished start screen and a clear ‘how to play’.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Scratch (web or app)']

## Do
- [ ] Open Session 10 project.
- [ ] Create a start screen backdrop (title + controls + goal).
- [ ] Gate game start behind a key press or click.
- [ ] Add a credits line (chosen name only).
- [ ] Test: restart twice to ensure it behaves.
- [ ] Download as `S11_final_v1.sb3` and upload.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Game starts immediately and skips start screen. Check: add one start gate variable or trigger block before gameplay scripts run. Retest: restart twice and confirm gate each time.
- Symptom: Restart breaks state. Check: reset key variables and positions on green flag or restart event. Retest: run two back-to-back playthroughs.
- Symptom: Credits show real names. Check: replace with chosen name/nickname only. Retest: preview start screen and confirm privacy-safe text.

## Extend
- Add sound toggle (mute/unmute).
- Add a difficulty selector (easy/normal).
- Purpose: packaging is care, make play approachable for others.
- Common snags:
  - Game starts immediately, missing gate.
  - Credits reveal real names, remind pseudonyms.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
