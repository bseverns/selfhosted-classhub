## Lesson summary
- Title: Piper Desktop Basics
- Session: 2
- Makes: Confidence navigating the Piper desktop and opening core apps.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Piper desktop']

## Do
- [ ] Boot the Piper kit to the desktop.
- [ ] Find the Wi‑Fi icon and volume icon (no need to connect if at school).
- [ ] Open `Piper` once; close it.
- [ ] Open `Pipercode` once; close it.
- [ ] Take a screenshot of the desktop (no personal info).
- [ ] Shut down safely.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- If keyboard/mouse is not responding, reseat USB and wait a few seconds.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Piper app will not open. Check: confirm the desktop finished loading and double-click only once, then wait. Retest: close and relaunch Piper after 10 seconds.
- Symptom: Mouse or keyboard does not respond. Check: reseat USB connection and confirm device lights/activity if available. Retest: move the cursor and type one key in a safe text field.
- Symptom: Student powers off without safe shutdown. Check: show the shutdown flow from the desktop menu before unplugging. Retest: power on again and confirm normal boot.

## Extend
- Create a folder called `ScratchProjects/` on the desktop or Documents.
- Practice reopening an app you closed.
- Purpose: reduce friction so the machine feels legible and student-controlled.
- Common snags:
  - Keyboard/mouse not detected.
  - Wi‑Fi list reveals network names, avoid showing on recordings.

## Piper kit readiness checks
1) Boot path is complete (desktop fully loaded, not stuck mid-boot).
2) Input devices work (mouse movement + click, keyboard keypress).
3) Audio/volume icon visible for StoryMode readiness.
4) Safe shutdown path is used before unplugging or rewiring.

## Vocabulary to use
- desktop, launcher, app icon, screenshot
- reboot, shutdown, USB input devices

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
