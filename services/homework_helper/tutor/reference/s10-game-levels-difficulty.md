# Reference: s10-game-levels-difficulty

## Lesson summary
- Title: Game III: Levels + Difficulty
- Session: 10
- Makes: Difficulty ramps over time or across levels.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Scratch (web or app)']

## Do
- [ ] Open Session 9 project.
- [ ] Add `level` variable (start at 1).
- [ ] Increase difficulty when score reaches a threshold (or timer).
- [ ] Make something change: speed, spawn rate, obstacle count.
- [ ] Add a simple instruction text (goal + controls).
- [ ] Download as `S10_levels_v1.sb3` and upload.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Level never increases. Check: verify threshold condition uses current score or timer variable and updates `level`. Retest: trigger threshold once and confirm level changes.
- Symptom: Difficulty spike is too harsh. Check: change one tuning value only (speed, spawn, or obstacle count) by a small step. Retest: play one round and compare fairness.
- Symptom: Instructions are ignored. Check: keep controls + goal text to one short line each on start. Retest: ask a peer to explain rules after one read.

## Extend
- Add an ‘easy mode’ toggle.
- Add a ‘practice mode’ with no hazards.
- Purpose: introduce pacing and tuning, games are systems that evolve.
- Common snags:
  - Difficulty jumps too sharply, smooth with smaller increments.
  - Instructions too long, keep short.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
