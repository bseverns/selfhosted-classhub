# Reference: s12-showcase-private-by-default

## Lesson summary
- Title: Showcase: Private-by-default
- Session: 12
- Makes: A private showcase post and a reflection; optional public share only by choice.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Scratch (web or app)']

## Do
- [ ] Upload your final `.sb3` file to the LMS.
- [ ] Post 1 screenshot (optional) and 1 sentence: what your game is.
- [ ] Write 5–8 sentences: what you learned / what you’re proud of / what you’d add next.
- [ ] Optional: If you *want*, share publicly; otherwise stop here.
- Stop point: if you submitted privately and wrote your reflection, you’re done.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Student thinks public sharing is required. Check: restate "private submit is complete credit; public share is optional." Retest: confirm student can finish with LMS-only submission.
- Symptom: Final `.sb3` seems missing. Check: open Downloads, locate latest `.sb3`, and re-open once locally. Retest: upload the confirmed file.
- Symptom: Reflection is too short or unclear. Check: use three prompts (learned, proud of, next idea). Retest: rewrite to 5-8 sentences.

## Extend
- Write a sequel idea in 3 bullets.
- Sketch your next game mechanic (one paragraph).
- Purpose: celebrate work without requiring exposure, reinforce agency and consent.
- Common snags:
  - Students think sharing is required, repeat "optional."
  - Students forget to keep a local copy, repeat download.

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
