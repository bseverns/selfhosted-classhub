# Reference: s01-welcome-private-workflow

## Lesson summary
- Title: Welcome + Private Workflow
- Session: 1
- Makes: A working StoryMode controller setup plus a saved Scratch file you own.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Piper desktop']

## Do
- [ ] Open Piper StoryMode (Mars) and build the first movement controls.
- [ ] Confirm at least one movement input works before adding more wires.
- [ ] Add/verify jump input in Cheeseteroid if your class reached that step.
- [ ] Open Scratch (web or app), make one tiny change, then save `S01_test_save_v1.sb3`.
- [ ] Upload the file to LMS and re-open once to prove you can resume work.
- Stop point: if one physical control works and `S01_test_save_v1.sb3` is uploaded, you are on track.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen or StoryMode will not launch.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- For wiring bugs: keep one known-good input, then compare failing jumper path to that one.
- Check shared ground before rewiring everything.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: Jump fails but movement still works. Check: confirm you are at the Cheeseteroid jump test moment and inspect only the jump input wire path + shared ground. Retest: press jump three times and report what changed.
- Symptom: No physical controls respond. Check: confirm StoryMode mission is open and one known-good button path is fully seated on the breadboard. Retest: test only one input before changing more wires.
- Symptom: File cannot be submitted. Check: open Downloads, sort by newest, and confirm the file ends in `.sb3`. Retest: re-open the file once, then upload.

## Extend
- Create a folder called `ScratchProjects/` and move your file into it.
- Rename your file to `..._v2` after one change.
- Purpose: establish private-first habits and reduce anxiety by making the workflow predictable.
- Common snags:
  - Students can’t find Downloads.
  - Students confuse "share" with "save".
  - A single misplaced jumper makes one control fail.

## Hardware quick checks (Session 1)
1) Confirm mission/test screen is open before judging wiring.
2) Verify each jumper is fully seated in the intended breadboard row.
3) Confirm shared ground path for all controls.
4) Test one input at a time; add complexity only after one control is reliable.
5) If behavior changed suddenly, undo last wire change first.

## Vocabulary to use
- StoryMode, Mars, Cheeseteroid
- movement input, jump input
- breadboard, jumper wire, shared ground, GPIO

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
