# Reference: s03-storymode-confidence

## Lesson summary
- Title: StoryMode: Guided Confidence
- Session: 3
- Makes: One completed guided StoryMode step with reliable controls and a short reflection.
- Needs: ['Piper computer kit (or any computer)', 'Piper desktop']

## Do
- [ ] Open `Piper` (StoryMode).
- [ ] Complete one guided step.
- [ ] Exit back to desktop.
- [ ] Write 3 sentences: what you did / what surprised you / what you want to try next.
- Stop point: if you completed one step and wrote your 3 sentences, you’re done.

## Help
- Reboot once if frozen.
- If movement or jump does not trigger, verify mission is on the expected test step.
- Check one input at a time; compare failing wire path to a known-good input.
- Check Downloads and try again.
- Use the help form to upload your `.sb3` or a screenshot.
- Ask for help: (link to LMS help form)

## Common stuck issues (symptom -> check -> retest)
- Symptom: StoryMode launches but controls fail at one point. Check: confirm the exact mission step where input is evaluated before rewiring. Retest: repeat that same step once after one wire change.
- Symptom: Student gets lost in long StoryMode sequence. Check: return to one guided step target and cap scope for this session. Retest: complete only the current step and submit evidence.
- Symptom: Upload evidence fails. Check: capture either one screenshot or a short `.txt` reflection as fallback. Retest: upload the fallback artifact privately.

## Extend
- Do one additional step only if you feel good.
- Write one question you’d like to explore later.
- Purpose: a low-stakes on-ramp, success first, complexity later.
- Common snags:
  - Students get pulled into long sequences, cap time.
  - Audio distraction, offer no-sound path.

## StoryMode control troubleshooting
1) Confirm mission and step: controls are tested only in certain on-screen moments.
2) Verify one control works first, then add/repair one wire at a time.
3) Re-check shared ground for all buttons/contacts.
4) If one action fails (for example jump), focus on that single input path only.
5) After fix, re-run the exact same test step to confirm.

## Vocabulary to use
- StoryMode step, input, action
- breadboard row, jumper wire, shared ground
- movement, jump, retest

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
